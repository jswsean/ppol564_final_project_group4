# Group 4 Final Project Repository

This repository hosts files that are used for Group 4's final project for the PPOL 564: Data Science I Foundations course. The repository is structured into 4 main folders,
which are listed as follows:

* **code**, which contains all the relevant scripts for data cleaning, data exploration, and producing graphs or other outputs.
* **graphs**, which contains all the graph outputs produced by the notebooks in the code subfolder.
* **output**, which contains all the LaTeX table outputs, the status update presentation, and the final report of this project.
* **references**, which contains all codebooks and/or other reference files that are used in the final project.  

Each folder contains a README that describes the details of the files that are located within that folder.

All the relevant datasets that are used in this project can be accessed in the below links:
